# Core Reservation Service
- Feature Name: core-reservation-service
- Start Date: 2023-06-12

## Summary

A core reservation service that solves the problem of reserving a resouce for a period of time.
We leverage postgres EXCLUDE constraints to ensure that only one reservation can be made for a given resouce at given time.

## Motivation

We need a common solution for various reservation requirments: 1) calendar booking; 2) hotel/room booking; 3) meeting room booking;
4) etc. Repeatedly building features for these requirments is a waste of time and resources. We should have a common that can be used by all teams.

### Service interface

We would use gRPC as a service interface. Below is the proto definition:

```proto
enum ReservationStatus {
    UNKNOWN = 0;
    PENDING = 1;
    CONFIRMED = 2;
    BLOCKED = 3;
}

enum ReservationUpdateType {
    UNKNOWN = 0;
    CREATE = 1;
    UPDATE = 2;
    DELETE = 3;
}

message Reservation {
    string id = 1;
    string user_id = 2;
    ReservationStatus status = 3;

    // resource reservation window
    string resource_id = 4;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp start = 5;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp end = 6;

    // extra note
    string note = 7;
}

message ReserveRequest {
    Reservation reservation = 1;
}

message ReserveResponse {
    Reservation reservation = 1;
}

message UpdateRequest {
    string note = 2;
}

message UpdateResponse {
    Reservation reservation = 1;
}

message ConfirmRequest {
    string id = 1;
}

message ConfirmResponse {
    Reservation reservation = 1;
}

message CancelRequest {
    string id = 1;
}

message CancelResponse {
    Reservation reservation = 1;
}

message GetRequest {
    string id = 1;
}

message GetResponse {
    Reservation reservation = 1;
}

message QueryRequest {
    string resource_id = 1;
    string user_id = 2;
    // use status to filter result. If UNKNOWN, return all reservations
    ReservationStatus status = 3;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp start = 4;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp end = 5;
}

message ListenRequest {}
message ListenResponse {
    int8 op = 1;
    Reservation reservation = 2;
}

service ReservationService {
    rpc reserve(ReserveRequest) returns (ReserveResponse);
    rpc confirm(ConfirmRequest) returns (ConfirmResponse);
    rpc update(UpdateRequest) returns (UpdateResponse);
    rpc cancel(CancelRequest) returns (CancelResponse);
    rpc get(GetRequest) returns (GetResponse);
    rpc query(QueryRequest) returns (stream Reservation);
    // another system could monitor newly added/confirmed/cancelled reservations
    rpc listen(ListenRequest) returns (stream Reservation);
}
```

### database scheme

We use postgres as the database. Below is the schema:

## Unresolved questions

- how to handle repeated reservation? - is this more ore less a business logic which shouldn't be put into this layer? (non-goal: we consider this is a business logic and should be handled by the caller)
- if load is big, we may use an external queue for recording changes.
- we haven't considered tracking/observability/deployment yet.
- query performance might be an issue - need to revisit the index and also consider using cache.
